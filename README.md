## HACSING: A Mistake/Fix Guide to Programming in HACS  

####Motivation
A fairly large number of NYU students have worked through HACS programming challenges
throughout the last couple of semesters. Like many other programming tools, there
is an initial learning curve, and a clear pattern in terms of repeated errors.
This guide is meant to facilitate climbing that curve by providing some commonly
seen errors and their respective fixes.


####Contributions
This is meant to be a collaborative exercise. So if you ever encounter a mistake,
and spend time finding a fix, please share that through a pull request.


####Running Programs
Each HACS program is meant to be minimal in nature and emphasize the specific error
it fixes. Each HACS error/fix consists of two files, one named "Error"
and the other named with "Fix", with each issue stored in a separate directory.
Each file has an initial comment detailing
how to reproduce the issue (often issues arise not just at runtime but at HACS
compile time).

All programs have been tested on CIMS energon1 using HACS 1.1.16

#####TODO
I'm currently working on adding
* "failed" matching with unreduced arguments
* missing a case in a scheme definition
* redefining a syntactic token
